Hi, I'm Bernardo.
I have several years of experience with many different programming languages, including
- high-level, dynamically-typed scripting languages, such as Python and JavaScript;
- pure functional languages such as Haskell;
- languages most commonly used for enterprise software development, such as C# and Java;
- low-level, statically-typed system programming languages, such as C, C++, and Rust.

I strongly believe in using the right tool for the task at hand, and see most hard rules in technology as obstacles to progress.
Reality is not simple.

Lately, I have been working on the specification and a reference implementation of my first programming language using Rust.
Furthermore, I have also been using C++ to implement real-time soft-body physics simulations.

I'm currently living in Berlin, but I'm willing to relocate for interesting job opportunities.
