Hi, I'm Bernardo. I have several years of experience with a multitude of programming languages, including high-level dynamically-typed scripting languages such as Python, purer functional languages such as Haskell, languages commonly used for enterprise software development, such as C# and Java, and low-level statically-typed languages such as C and C++.

Preferences aside, I am a strong believer in using the right tool for the job at hand and often question maxims and universal truths in technology.

Recently, I have been interested in cybersecurity and safe systems programming using Rust.

You can find [my portfolio here](https://www.bernardosulzbach.com/portfolio/). Feel free to [reach out to me by email](mailto:bernardo@bernardosulzbach.com).

I am willing to relocate for interesting job opportunities.
