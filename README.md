Hi, I'm Bernardo.
I have several years of experience with a multitude of programming languages, including high-level dynamically-typed scripting languages such as Python, purer functional languages such as Haskell, languages commonly used for enterprise software development, such as C# and Java, and lower-level statically-typed system programming languages, such as C, C++, and Rust.

I strongly believe in using the right tool for the job at hand, and see most hard rules in technology as obstacles to progress.
Reality is not simple.

Lately, I have been working on the specification and the Rust implementation of my first programming language and real-time soft-body physics simulation using C++.

You can find [my portfolio here](https://www.bernardosulzbach.com/portfolio/).
Feel free to [reach out to me by email](mailto:bernardo@bernardosulzbach.com).

I am willing to relocate for interesting job opportunities.
